# Markdown - The Basics

GitHub Pages is a service that provides a simple solution for one to create their own customized webpage.  Formatted text, user uploaded images, and applying basic themes to your webpage is possible by using a syntax style called Markdown.  In minutes you can upload your content and have a URL path to display your document.  

Markdown adds style to your Github Page by using simple rules within your content.  Formatting text with the applicable keyboard operators can thematically transform your webpage.  Headers, lists, and styles are easily customizable by placing Markdown special characters throughout your text.  Sometimes these use a combination of ```*``` asterisks or ```#``` hash symbols placed around your text.

One major theme of Markdown is that an operator must exist before and after the content you are trying to alter.  For instance, if I were going to add a reference link for Markdown syntax to my page, it would look like this:
```

```

This example makes use of the ```()``` parenthesis and ```[]``` brackets to enclose a link.  The parenthesis open and close within the text you want your page to display, and the brackets open and close around that URL.  As a result, we get this link:
