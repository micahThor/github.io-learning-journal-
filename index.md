### About Me
Hello everyone, my name is Micah.  I grew up in central Florida, and like many veterans I have called many places home over the years (Mississippi, Texas, Arizona, Guam).  

I am a former avionics technician with ten years experience in military and commercial applications.  In my former occupation I have served in the Air Force, completed contracts for the Army, and worked for Bombardier Aerospace.  I hope to utilize the technical proficiences I utilized as an aircraft technician into my next endeavor!

Some of my hobbies include:
* Hiking leisure trails with my dog
* Card games
* Soccer (go Sounders!)


### On the Horizon
Almost three years ago I set out for the great Pacific Northwest in search for my next career.  Currently I am in the process of reinventing my skillset as a software developer in **Amazon's SDE Apprenticeship Program**.  In preparation for this challenge I have graduated from North Seattle College with an Associates in Programming and Networking.


### Growth Mindset
In order for one to be successful in a technical capacity, there must be an inate desire to learn.  The growth mindset is a deliberate reframing of your thought processes to better adapt to new and often difficult systems.  
#### Reminders
- Preparation for obstacles
   - Learning can be a frustrating experience if you aren't prepared.  Maintaing a clear mind, showing up on time, and having tools on-hand can increase my growth mindset.
- Collaboration over brute force
   - Teaming up on challenging problems can be both a learning and teaching moment.  By engaging with colleagues instead of tackling issues alone, I can glean the important content while keeping my mind open to other's proficiencies.
- Failure isn't an option, but it's part of the process
   - Learning a new career can be especially difficult in the beginning.  While I must maintain the highest standards of learning, I must account for new technologies to be challenging.  When I encounter a failure on my part, that is my opportunity to react and make positive of the situation.
