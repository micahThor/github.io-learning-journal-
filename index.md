### About Me
Hello everyone, my name is Micah.  I grew up in central Florida, and like many of you veterans I have called many places home over the years (Mississippi, Texas, Arizona, Guam).  

I am a former avionics technician with ten years experience in military and commercial applications.  In my former occupation I have served in the Air Force, completed contracts for the Army, and worked for Bombardier Aerospace.  I hope to utilize the technical proficiences I utilized as an aircraft technician into my next endeavor!

Some of my hobbies include:
*Hiking leisure trails
*Card games
*Soccer (go Sounders!)


### On the Horizon
Almost three years ago I set out for the great Pacific Northwest in search for my next career.  Currently I am in the process of reinventing my skillset as a software developer in Amazon's SDE apprenticeship program.  In preparation for this challenge I have graduated from North Seattle College with an Associates in Programming and Networking.


### Growth Mindset
In order for one to be successful in a technical capacity, there must be an inate desire to learn.  The growth mindset is a deliberate reframing of your thought processes to better adapt to new and often difficult systems.
