# A Git Introduction
Version control is a fundamental concept for teams working and collaborating on projects.  The ability to download/modify/upload content from distributed repositories to your local machine enables programmers to seamlessly work together.  Git is the core technology that makes this possible.  By using Git, teams can be sure that the most updated version of their product is available for actions such as pulling, pushing, cloning, and committing.

According to the author of Git Tutorial: A Comprehensive Guide, Jenny Choi, Git is:
> [a] DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it.

Programmers can use a wide variety of tools to utilize Git technology.  There are dedicated GUI programs, text editors, and probably the most prevalent, the command line.  Understanding command line functions is vital to succeeding in creating a product within a team.

For instance, if you wanted to create a local repository, you would enter this command:
```
$ git init
```

Or if you wanted to commit new changes to a file, you would enter this command:
```
$ git commit
```

These command line functions accept multiple arguments to further their potential.  One could specify file names, directories, or document the changes made to a particular file.
