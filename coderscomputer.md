# The Coder's Computer Review

The author of this piece suggests that the importance of the "right" text editor is simply the one that helps you do your job the most.  Picking the right text editor should be personal to each developer because we must all seek the right tool for the job.

**Classifications of text editors:**

1. Simple text editors - These often come from an operating system's preinstalled software package.  This could include Notepad for Windows and TextEdit for Macs.  These editors are the bottom of the bells and whistles ladder.  These are plain text editors that do not support formatting, nor do they provide code context through highlighting.
2. Web enabled text editors - These text editors have "knowledge" of languages such as HTML or CSS.  Features often include auto-tag completion, context highlights, and color coded text. Overall these editors provide web developer tools to be more proficient.
3. IDE (Integrated Development Environment) text editors - These text editors are frequently used by programmers.  They provide a package of editor, compiler, debugger, and file manager for a developer to maintain and create code.  These editors understand your chosen programming language, and can provide syntax assistance, code completion, and a variety of quality of life features to enable software developers.
