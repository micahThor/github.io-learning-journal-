# Html Exercise

[Hey, I'm not the most design-oriented programmer out there, but check out my site anyways!](https://micahthor.github.io/code102HTMLex/)


In this exercise I built a small website featuring my favorite soccer team, the Seattle Sounders.  Almost ten years ago I took a basic intro to web design course which helped in this assignment, but ultimately HTML5 has come a long way from humble beginnings.  I think the most challenging part of creating a webpage is getting your content aligned.  Using a variety of styles becomes cumbersome if you don't keep your content in-check.  The process of this exercise involved a lot of trial and error, which translates to valuable learning experiences.  Overall I triumphed and was able to utilize many differebt html elements to create a *somewhat* visually striking webpage.  Enjoy!

One aspect of web design that I focused on for this project was to keep my style and content separated.  By using  ```<style>...</style>``` elements in the ```head``` section, I was able to focus all my content in the various elements of page's body.  I hope in future exercises to create a separate CSS file to further segregate the visual sources content from the content itself.
