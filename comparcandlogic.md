# Computer Architecture and Logic


### Basic computing functions

Every computer, tablet, and smart phone can be boiled down to these four basic computing concepts.

1. Input -  This function determines how users interact with their devices.  A mouse, keyboard, or the swipe of a finger are all considered input.  Modern computers are powerful because they perform real-time functions based of live user inputs.

2. Store - The ability to retain memory in the form of application and data is another computing fundamental.  Storage can be local like hard drives and USB sticks or remote like cloud servers.  Storage can also be short-term, in the form of volatile memory, or permanent like the old hard drive sitting in your storage closet.    

3. Process - Computer processing involves taking something raw and turning it into something useful.  Computer processors have greatly accelerated ever since the invention of the microchip.  Modern computers that can fit in your palm are capable of performing processing functions that would take an entire room of early computers.  Processing functions automate and accelerate the problem-solving aspect of computing that makes our lives easier.

4. Output - Generating results in a timely fashion is a staple of modern computing.  A computer's output is the outcome of the three previous computing functions.  An output is considered to be a solution or product that we have programmed a computer to solve.


### Marrying hardware and software

The concept of hardware and software differentiate the physical and non-physical components that make up a computer.  For instance, the hardware in a standard desktop might include a power supply, motherboard, graphics card, hard drive, and fan case.  These are physical components that synchronize to make your computer work efficiently.  Within the hardware is where the software exists.  The software involves operating systems, application, and all associated data.  While these two computer layers are considered seperate, they are integral to each other.
