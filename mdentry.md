GitHub Pages is a service that provides a simple solution for one to create their own customized webpage.  Formatted text, user uploaded images, and applying basic themes to your webpage is possible by using a syntax style called Markdown.  In minutes you can upload your content and have a URL path to display your document.  

Markdown adds style to your Github Page by using simple rules within your content.

For instance, if I were going to add a reference link for Markdown syntax to my page, it would look like this:
```
**[Click here for Markdown reference page](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#quoting-code)**
```
