# Publishing Content Changes

In this exercise I cloned my Github's Learning Journal repository to my local machine.  Then using VS Code, I was able to make changes to my content, and have those changes reflected on my Github repository.

Some basic terminology/commands that I learned and utilized in this exercise:
* Github commands
  * push
  * pull

This exercise entailed some trial and error to get my local content synced with my online content.  The benefits of having a safe place to work became apparent when I accidentally deleted one of my files.  Overall this exercise was a good learning experience when it comes to updating and modifying files.
